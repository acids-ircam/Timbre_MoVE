# Modulated Variational Auto-Encoders for Many-to-Many Musical Timbre Transfer (MoVE)


Companion repository of: Adrien Bitton, Philippe Esling, Axel Chemla-Romeu-Santos, "Modulated Variational Auto-Encoders for Many-to-Many Musical Timbre Transfer".
+ The paper can be accessed at: https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00222 and was submitted to the ICLR 2019.
+ Reviews can be found at: https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgOl3AqY7 ; however they could not be met on time.

**Please refer to docs/README.md for viewing the demonstration content currently available.**

The experiments have been partly finalized in the form of an expressive note sample generator.

Near-future works will target the end-to-end waveform modelling with variable note length, temporal structure and dynamic conditioning.
